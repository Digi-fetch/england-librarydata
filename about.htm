        <h2>public library open data</h2>
        <p>Public library data is rich, varied, interesting, and there is a great demand for it.  But with more public open data available than ever, data about libraries is still very rare.</p>
        <p>Other than protecting citizen personal information, all data related to public libraries should be made openly licensed, and freely available for anyone to use.  The Libraries Taskforce for England have released their <a href="https://librariestaskforce.blog.gov.uk/" title="Libraries Taskforce" target="_blank">core libraries dataset</a>, compiled by the Taskforce and validated by the 151 library authorities in England.  A core libraries dataset is at a minimum what the public should know about libraries.  Where are they? Where were the ones that closed? How many are there?  What about the different types of library, and how has that changed: volunteer, local authority, commissioned?</p>
        <p>This data doesn't answer any great questions about outcomes of library usage on society, the value of libraries, or provide significant measures.  But good location data and counts <strong>are</strong> important.  A single location holds a great deal of associated information.  Deprivation indices measure the deprivation of an area, under categories such as income, education, housing, and crime.  Public Libraries in England are also tied to our local government administrations, all with different geographical profiles.  Some may be rural widespread areas that require a different approach to a library service in a London Borough, or in a Unitary City authority.</p>
        <h2>this project</h2>
        <p>This project is experimental, using open datasets such as authority boundaries, population stats, and deprivation indices.  These are merged with the core libraries dataset to provide alternative ways of exploring the data.
        <p>It may not always be correct, and the methodology is likely to have plenty of issues, but it is open source.  This means the full code is <a href="https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/public-libraries-news" target="_blank" title="This repository on GitHub">hosted on GitHub</a>.  A <a href="https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/public-libraries-news/blob/master/library-db.md" target="_blank" title="Step by step guide to creating database">step-by-step description</a> of how the underlying data was merged with other sources is given as part of that code.</p>
        <p>If you find any errors then shout about these, but also please suggest improvements and features.  For those with GitHub accounts you can raise bugs and feature requests (and get involved in the coding).</p>
        <p>The core dataset is a start, at a national level, for English public libraries open data.  As well as maintaining and improving that dataset, it should be a first step to more data.  Loans, expenditure, footfall, PC usage, catalogue data, and more - for all library services in England.  These are datasets that could be used by the public to create real insight into library usage.  There should be no need to prove the value of libraries, but there's plenty to gain from a better understanding of the data, and using that to improve services.</p>

        <h2>comments on the dataset</h2>
        <p>The Libraries Taskforce dataset is not intended to be a finished product, it is a first version of a dataset that has a long way to go.  But it requires investment in time by the library services, and those who want to use the data.  Here are an initial set of commments on the current version.</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <thead>
                <tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>Current field: Library service</td><td>The library authoritity e.g. Gloucestershire.  Some issues with this field are the variety of ways of expressing the name, which may not match to official stats.  For example, 'Bath and NE Somerset', where Bath and North East Somerset should probably be used.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Current field: Library name</td><td>Standardisation of naming conventions would be useful here.  For example, some are appended with 'library', others not.  Some have very descriptive names such as 'Anlaby Library and Customer Service Centre at East Riding Leisure Haltemprice' - some of that information may be more appropriate in the address details.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><span class="text-danger">Suggested field: Unique Property Reference Number</span></td><td>This suggested field would be the local authority Unique Property Reference Number.  This identifier is a single reference that would allow cross matching of the address to various other local authority datasets.  This reference would also allow for exact geo-coordinates of the location, taking these from Ordnance Survey data.  This is not open data but there is a 'presumption to publish' for various government datasets - generally provided the information does not compromise OS commercial capabilities.  A 3000 dataset of libraries would not seriously damage OS commercial property, so a request could likely be made to allow this data to be released with an open licence.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><span class="text-danger">Suggested field: Longitude</span></td><td>From the above reference number it would be possible to include the latitude coordinate of the library.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><span class="text-danger">Suggested field: Latitude</span></td><td>From the above reference number it would be possible to include the latitude coordinate of the library.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Modify field: Postal address</td><td>Suggested discard: </td></tr>
                <tr><td>Modify field: Postcode</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Current field: Included in statutory service on 1 April 2010</td><td>The statutory service indicator is used variably by authorities.  The majority .  However Cornwall claim that statutory library provision has risen from 31 statutory libraries in 2010 to 48 in 2016.  This is due to the fact that they have marked the 17 community 'micro' libraries.  These libraries offer around 200 books where customers self serve on an honesty basis.  Due to the dubious nature of this being part of statutory provision, this project overrrides the statutory indication to 'No' if the library is of type CL or ICL.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Current field: Included in statutory service on 1 July 2016</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Current field: Type of library</td><td>LAL, LAL-, CL, CRL, CRL+, ICL, ICL+.  </td></tr>
                <tr><td>XL: Closed library</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Year of closure</td><td>There's little room for ambiguity here but the library services manage a lot of variation.  'Dec-12', 'Sept 2012', 2012, and more.  The month could be useful, but without a defined structure makes it more difficult to use this field.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>New building since 1 April 2010: insert year of opening</td><td>One entry decides that a simple number iOne library service goes for 'Will be same as Cheltenham Road' - which if the case, shouldn't it just BE the same as Cheltenham Road?</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Did the new building replace an existing library: Yes/No</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Notes</td><td>General notes field.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Number of hours open each week</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Number of staffed hours each week</td><td>Bournemouth have gone quite leftfield on this field and decided that there are far more staffed hours for each library than there are overall hours.  For example Charminster library is open 39 hours a week, including 148.75 staffed hours.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Contact email</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>URL of library website</td><td></td></tr>
